# Room 1221 Admin System Software Requirements Specification

## 1. Document Control
- **Product**: Room 1221 Admin System
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Status**: Draft SRS aligned to the current shipped admin implementation
- **Audience**: Product owners, developers, QA, operations, and administrators

## 2. Purpose
The Room 1221 admin system provides a separate, secure administrative interface for monitoring platform activity, managing users and staff access, reviewing safety incidents, checking system health, and exporting reports.

This SRS defines the functional and non-functional requirements for the current admin system as implemented in the codebase.

## 3. Scope
The admin system is available at `/dashboard` and is isolated from the main user application.

In scope:
- Analytics dashboard
- User and staff management
- Safety and crisis management
- System health monitoring
- System logs for user-to-system and admin/system events
- Report generation and export
- Separate admin login and logout flow

Out of scope:
- Content library management
- Configuration page for administrative settings
- Public user app features such as chat, story mode, pharmacy, and settings
- Real production authentication backend

## 4. System Overview
The admin system is composed of a dedicated admin route, a login gate, a sidebar navigation shell, and modular management screens.

### 4.1 Entry Points
- `/dashboard` opens the admin login or the admin panel if authenticated
- Admin authentication uses a stored session token in local storage
- Logout clears the admin session and returns the user to the login page

- Analytics Dashboard
- User Management
- Safety & Crisis
- System Health
- Reports

## 5. Stakeholders and User Classes

## 13. Traceability Summary

| Requirement Area | Current Implementation |
|---|---|
| Authentication | `src/AdminDashboardApp.tsx`, `src/components/AdminDashboardLogin.tsx` |
| Navigation | `src/components/AdminPanel.tsx`, `src/components/AdminSidebar.tsx` |
| Analytics | `src/components/EnhancedAdminDashboard.tsx` |
| User Management | `src/components/AdminUserManagement.tsx` |
| Safety Management | `src/components/AdminSafetyManagement.tsx` |
| System Health | `src/components/AdminSystemHealth.tsx` |
| Reports | `src/components/AdminReports.tsx` |
| Data Models | `src/types/analytics.ts` |
| Data Services | `src/services/analyticsService.ts`, `src/services/staffAccessService.ts` |

## 14. Assumptions and Dependencies
- The current admin experience uses seeded demo data.
- Report exports are generated client-side.
- The dashboard is intended for internal admin use only.
- Future production authentication and backend integration may replace the current demo token and localStorage model.

## 15. Future Enhancements
- Real authentication and RBAC
- Backend-backed audit logging
- Persistent report archive
- Export scheduling and saved report templates
- Configurable alert thresholds for system health and safety
